# nanograd

nanograd is an autograd engine I made inspired by Andrej Karpathy's micrograd and pytorch. Unlike micrograd, nanograd supports Tensors and multidimensional arrays/vectors. I made this to learn and understand how neural networks are trained using autograd and how deeplearning libraries like pytorch work.

The end goal for nanograd is to be able to run gpt-2 (124M params) - again inspired by Andrej Karpathy. Still a long way to go to get there though.
